# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds file upload and instant summary capabilities to the Operations Manager Dashboard in the KMRL Portal. The feature allows operations managers to upload documents (PDF, DOCX, or TXT files) and receive immediate operational summaries to help with decision-making and compliance tracking. The system uses simulated ML summarization that can later be replaced with actual ML models.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an Operations Manager, I want to upload operational documents through a dedicated dashboard section, so that I can quickly access document processing capabilities without navigating away from my main workspace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Operations Manager accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a new "File Upload & Summary" card/section
2. WHEN the user views the upload section THEN the system SHALL provide both drag-and-drop and button-based file upload options
3. WHEN the user interacts with the upload area THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback for drag-and-drop states
4. IF the upload section is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design across all device sizes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an Operations Manager, I want to upload PDF, DOCX, or TXT files, so that I can process various types of operational documents that I commonly work with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user attempts to upload a file THEN the system SHALL only accept PDF, DOCX, and TXT file formats
2. IF the user uploads an unsupported file format THEN the system SHALL display an error message and reject the upload
3. WHEN a valid file is selected THEN the system SHALL display the file name and size before submission
4. IF the file exceeds size limits THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an Operations Manager, I want to submit uploaded files for processing, so that I can receive operational summaries to inform my decision-making.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has selected a valid file THEN the system SHALL enable the submit button
2. WHEN the user clicks submit THEN the system SHALL send the file to the backend API endpoint /api/upload-summary
3. WHEN file processing begins THEN the system SHALL display a loading spinner and disable the submit button
4. IF the submission fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and re-enable the submit button

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an Operations Manager, I want to see realistic operational summaries of my uploaded documents, so that I can quickly understand key operational insights and compliance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend processes a file THEN the system SHALL return a simulated operational summary within 3 seconds
2. WHEN a summary is generated THEN the system SHALL display realistic operational content including safety alerts, compliance notes, or operational reminders
3. WHEN multiple files are processed THEN the system SHALL provide varied summary content to simulate realistic scenarios
4. WHEN the summary is displayed THEN the system SHALL format it in a clear, readable summary box

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an Operations Manager, I want the file upload feature to integrate seamlessly with the existing dashboard design, so that it feels like a natural part of my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the upload section is added THEN the system SHALL use consistent Tailwind CSS styling with the existing dashboard
2. WHEN the upload section is displayed THEN the system SHALL use Radix UI components for consistent interaction patterns
3. WHEN the feature loads THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing dashboard performance and responsiveness
4. IF the dashboard layout changes THEN the upload section SHALL adapt appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to handle file uploads securely and efficiently, so that the system can be extended with real ML capabilities in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend receives a file upload THEN the system SHALL use multer middleware for secure file handling
2. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate file size and type validation
3. WHEN generating summaries THEN the system SHALL return structured JSON responses for consistent frontend handling
4. IF the system is extended with ML capabilities THEN the current simulation logic SHALL be easily replaceable

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an Operations Manager, I want smooth and intuitive user interactions, so that I can efficiently process documents without technical friction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the upload feature THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback for all user actions
2. WHEN files are being processed THEN the system SHALL show clear loading states and progress indicators
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages with suggested actions
4. WHEN the feature is used on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain full functionality and usability
